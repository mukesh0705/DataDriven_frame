POM:Page Object Model
=====================
It is a design pattern in which help you to maintain the code and code duplication which is a
crucial thing in test automation.

you can store all locators and respective method in the separate class and call them from the
test in which you have to use,so the benifit from this will be if any changes in page then 
you do not have to modify the test,simply modify the respective page and thats all.

you can create a layer between your test and application pages,which you have to automate.

In other word, it will behave as object repository where all locator are saves.
